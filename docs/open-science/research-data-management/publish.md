# Publish your data

Sharing your data with the scientific community is a milestone for your research, for this reason the best way to share your data and your findings with others is to make them open, transparent and especially interoperable.

If you have followed the previous recommendations up to now, your data should be almost ready to be shared.

## Restrictions, sensitive data and legal issues

The following are the general questions that you should ask yourself when thinking of the legal aspects of sharing your research.

- **Who does own the data generated by my research?**
- **What do I need to consider when sharing, publishing and archiving data?**
- **How do I handle data with sensitive information?**
- **Under which conditions can third-party data be re-used for my research?**

## Where to share your data

There are multiple platforms to make your data public, here just a few of the most popular ones:

- [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/)
- [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
- [RDC at ZPID](https://rdc-psychology.org/)

If you expect and whish other people to have a more interactive and collaborative approach to your code
consider to share it also in other platforms such as Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket. Refer to the section about [code sharing].

## Pre-registration

Pre-registration is a relatively recent approach to do research, it is based on the assumption that registering in advance, to a dedicated platform, a detailed report of the experimental and analysis procedure one would follow, it would contribute to a more transparent and reproducible science.
One of the fundamental aspects of pre-registration is a clear distinction between **confirmatory-hypothesis** and **exploratory-hypothesis**, or in other words the distinction between the hypothesis put forward before data collection, the prediction,  and the exploratory post-hoc hypothesis, the postdiction. Pre-gistration does not favor one or the other hypothesis, as it should be, it considers both fundamental for the advancement of science, but it requires a net distinction when data and results are published.

For a more comprehensive presentation of pre-registration refer to [Nosek et al, 2018](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1708274114).

You can pre-register your research in the [center for open science](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg) website.
