The following are the general questions that you should ask yourself when thinking of the legal aspects of sharing your research.

- **Who does own the data generated by my research?**
- **What do I need to consider when sharing, publishing and archiving data?**
- **How do I handle data with sensitive information?**
- **Under which conditions can third-party data be re-used for my research?**
