# Archive your data

Although archiving evokes the end of a process, for research data this is only a further step aiming at the preservation of the physical files for a long time (at least 10 years) and at the same time aiming at the re-usal of such data.

## Where are data archived at Ipsy?

At Ipsy, after a project has been concluded and published, data are then archived upon request of the principal investigator.
Cecile, the computational cluster, provides a dedicated secure storage called [`archive`]. When a project is in the process of being archived, the metadata contained in the `project-metadata.json` file and generated upon project creation gets updated and the project gets cristallized in the final status. 
[`archive`]: ../../../cluster/cecile/data/#cecile-data-structure

## Access to archived projects

Archived projects can be accessed at any time by the researches who hold the access permission, or who are given permission. Project can also be resumed at any time upon request.
