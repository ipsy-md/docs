# Archive your data

Although archiving evokes the end of process, for research data this is only a further step that aims at preserving the physical files for a long time and at the same time at allowing the re-usal of such data.

## Where are data archived at Ipsy?

At Ipsy, after a project has been concluded and published, data are then archived upon request of the principal investigator. 
Cecile provides a dedicated secure storage, [`archive`], that cristallizes the projects in the final status. Archived projects can be accessed at any time by the researches and resumed upo request.
[`archive`]: ../../cluster/cecile/data/##cecile-data-structure
