# Archive your data

Although archiving evokes the end of a process, for research data this is only a further step that aims at preserving the physical files for a long time and at the same time at allowing the re-usal of such data.

## Where are data archived at Ipsy?

At Ipsy, after a project has been concluded and published, data are then archived upon request of the principal investigator. 
Cecile, the computational cluster, provides a dedicated secure storage called [`archive`]. When a project is in the process of being archived, `project-metadata.json` file containing essential metadata created upon project creation, gets updated and the project get cristallized in the final status. 
[archive]: ../../../cluster/cecile/data/#cecile-data-structure

## Access to achived projects

Archived projects can be accessed at any time by the researches who hold the access permission, or who are given permission. Project can also be resumed at any time upon request.
