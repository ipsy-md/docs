# Software stack

In Cecile softwares are provided systemwise through a so called **software stack**, a collection of softwares, which is generated using the [**Spack package manager**](https://spack.io/).

A software stack contains a number of softwares necessary for your analysis and many more. If any software you might need is missing from the stack you need to contact `manuela.kuhn at ovgu.de`.


## Type of stacks

Currently there are **two kinds of stacks** available: 

1. **Current stack:** A stack that is kept stable throughout one semester. Each semester a new stable stack is created from scratch, while the old `current stacks` are still in place and can be used by specifying the the date in the following way: `current_<date>`.
2. **Experimental stack**: A flexible stack that is going to be frequently updated also upon user's request. 

!!! Danger "Multiple software versions in Experimental stack"
    Continuous updating in the `experimental stack` can lead to have multiple versions of the same software (e.g. `python ~gcc@11.0` vs `python ~gcc@11.1`) in the `experimental stack`, therefore be careful to load the correct version when using the experimental stack. Usually back compatibility between software versions is mantained, but sometimes this might not be the case and some feature might have been changed. 



!!! note "Why two different stacks (use case):"
    If you need to use a software that is not yet available on Cecile (in the `current stack`), after your request, the missing software is going to be installed in the `experimental stack`

## How to use the stacks

There are multiple ways to access the stack depending on the control you want over the versions of softwares you would like to use:

### Load the Ipsy environment (recommended method)

Instead of loading every package individually, you can activate an evironment containing only the newest version of each package. 

=== "Current stack"

    ```bash
    . /software/current/ipsy-env/activate
    ```

    Now that the stack has been loaded, you can start each single software.

    ```bash
    python
    ```

    In order to see which softwares are available in the environment type the following command:

    ```bash
    module avail
    ```

=== "Experimental stack"

    ```bash
    . /software/experimental/ipsy-env/activate
    ```
    
    Now that the stack has been loaded, you can start each single software.

    ```bash
    python
    ```

    In order to see which softwares are available in the environment type the following command:

    ```bash
    module avail
    ```

### Via modules

For every installed package spack generates a module file in addition, this allows to use the `module` cammand to load specific softwares.

```bash
. /software/experimental/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```

To see what packages are installed run
```bash
module avail
```

To load a package (in case a specific version is needed, load the version of the software shown by `module avail`)
```bash
module load python
```
