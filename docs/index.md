# Welcome to Ipsy docs

## What is Ipsy docs?

Ipsy docs is a work in progress collection of resources, tutorials and guidelines to ease reproducible and open science at the Institute of Psychology at OvGU. 

## Objectives of Ipsy Docs

- Provide a guide for research data management (RDM). [:material-file-document-check: RDM](open-science/research-data-management/getting-started/){ .md-button } 

- Provide support and documentation for a fair and effective cluster usage.[:fontawesome-solid-server: Cluster](cluster){ .md-button } 

!!! note "Before starting"
    These pages require little prior knowledge from the user, but even if you are an experienced researcher, we recommend you to go through them, and especially to read carefully the sections dedicated to the cluster, data and backups.
